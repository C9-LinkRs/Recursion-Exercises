# Recursivity-Exercises
I will post here several recursivity exercises that i will do.

Problems:
1) Find n-th fibonacci value with a recursive function with one parameter.
2) With this formula i can know all the ways that i can choose "r" things in a "n" group: C = n! * (r! * (n - r)!), Find a recursive version of this formula and implement it.
3) Write a recursive function that sort an array from the lowest to the biggest element.
4) Write a recursive function that get the sum of the first "N" integers.
5) Write a recursive function that get the sum of pair integers from "N" to 2.
