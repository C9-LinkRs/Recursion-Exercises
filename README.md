# Recursion exercises
I will post here several recursivity exercises that i will do.

Problems:
1) Find n-th fibonacci value with a recursive function with one parameter.
2) With this formula i can know all the ways that i can choose "r" things in a "n" group: C = n! * (r! * (n - r)!), Find a recursive version of this formula and implement it.
3) Write a recursive function that sort an array from the lowest to the biggest element.
4) Write a recursive function that get the sum of the first "N" integers.
5) Write a recursive function that get the sum of pair integers from "N" to 2.
6) Write a recursive function that get the  GCD (greatest common divisor) of "m" and "n" like that: GCD = m if n ==0, if n != 0 then GCD = GCD(n, m mod n). If m < n, the code will switch the variable.
7) Write a recursive function for convert a number to binary notation.
8) Write a recursive function for convert a binary number to base 10 number.
9) Write a recursive function for get the sum of all elements of an integer array.
10) Write a recursive function for invert an integer array.
